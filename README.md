# TheGameThatLearns 
Small project created for an UConn Artificial Intelligence club event aimed at introducing children to coding and artificial intelligence.
The code was written by myself and was based on the YouTube video "The game that learns" by Vsauce2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7UAZNgGg8

The main python file "TheGameThatLearns.py" contains a fully working version of the code and can be run as an executable.
The folder "SkeletonVersions" contains multiple different, incomplete versions of the code intended to be filled in by the
people attending the event. Each of the functions they use have been abstracted into a more intuitive form as to serve as
an easy introduction to coding. There are three versions of the skeleton code: "S", "SEasier", and "SHarder". As one may
expect, the "SHarder" file gives the student less starter code while "SEasier" includes more starter code.

The file "TheGameThatLearns.pdf" contains descriptions of the various functions and variables the students were intended to
use when attempting to complete the skeleton code. These functions have been abstracted in such a way that they should be 
intuitive for most first time coders. Included is also a short blueprint that outlines the structure the student should use
for their code and explains how basic python operations work (ie. if statements, while loops, ect.).
